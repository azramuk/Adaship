# Adaship

To run:

Head to https://replit.com/github to import a repository. Using https://github.com/azramuk/Adaship then just run it using console

1. Challenge Outline – 10%
a. Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.

what version and what it includes

b. UML style diagram illustrating initial overall solution (linked to 1a)

diagrams for all (3) versions

c. Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality (linked to 1a,
1b).

bottom up, split into seperate tasks, saw what code could be reused amongst tasks and split those up for reusability sake

d. Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‘epic’ style tasks (linked to 1b, 1c).

explain diagrams? 

e. Initial object-oriented design ideas and planned phased breakdown into smaller tasks (linked to 1d).

break down by versions and then by tasks - open file, read contents, configure boards etc, worked on player workflow then computer, manual then auto, merging of reused code for auto and making com and user one class


3. Development – 15%
a. Adoption and use of ‘good’ standards (linked to 1a, 1b, 1c).

code reusability, private attributes

b. Phase 1 development: tasks, code review and changes (linked to 1d,1e).

one big file with repeated code for version 1

c. ..repeated for each development phase.

breaking into files, reusing code, merging similar classes, testing in each stage at every function implementation, unit testing then integration
version 2
version 3


d. Phase n development: tasks, code review and changes (linked to 1d,1e).

last stage code cleanup and testing

e. Ensuring quality through testing and resolving bugs (linked to 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b..2c).

repeat testing, what bugs came where and overall solution e.g taking string inputs then converting to avoid type errors

f. Reflection on key design challenges, innovations and how they were solved (with examples).

initial user and computer seperate but lots of repeated code so created a tag instead, array for boats then created objects beacause messy indexing to get attributes

3. Evaluation (academic standard: distinction level detail: section required for distinction) – 10%
a. Analysis with embedded examples of key code refactoring, reuse, smells.

adaship global variable, seperate com and player class, copying arrays not working before

b. Implementation and effective use of ‘advanced’ programming principles (with examples).

look at google classroom - reading config file singleton, states

c. Features showcase and embedded innovations (with examples) - opportunity to ‘highlight’ best bits.



d. Improved algorithms – research, design, implementation, and tested confirmation (with examples).

UI improvements? salvo version bringing num of shots so can be reused

e. Reflective review, opportunities to improve and continued professional development.
